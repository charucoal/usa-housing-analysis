# Housing Price Trends in Populous U.S. States

## Overview

This project analyzes housing price trends within the domain of real estate and housing economics, focusing on 10 of the 25 most populous U.S. states. These states represent diverse and high-demand real estate markets that face challenges such as increasing population density, urbanization, and affordability.

## Domain Context

Housing prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including property size, location, and population density. This study emphasizes how these variables interact, with a particular focus on how densely populated states affect the relationship between property size (measured in square feet) and housing prices.

## Objectives

- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a linear regression model to estimate housing prices based on property size and geographic location.
- **Market Analysis**: Examine how population density influences pricing dynamics across urban and suburban areas.
- **Stakeholder Insights**: Offer practical insights for homeowners, real estate investors, and policymakers.
- **Economic Contribution**: Support strategic planning and policy development in housing economics.
